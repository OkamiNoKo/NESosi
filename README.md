original github is 
https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES

Another links you can find in youtube description. So i think i doesnt break any of rules above.

That code not just only copy or rewriting original code, and not reunderstending or optimization. That piece of code in that project is just another interpretation on another language. It will (not) work on Java language.
